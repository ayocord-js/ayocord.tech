## Little bit history?

I always write handlers for my bots and it was really boring and sometimes hard <br>
For each commands you **must** create files <br>
In python discord libraries we're using decorators for solving this problem <br>
One class = one module (cog in python sleng), however I hate python and love TypeScript ecosystem but this way for creating discord bots I like and I decided to create this framework <br>
